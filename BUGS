Item movement / ContainerManager:
  - Item is removed but not added if canAddItem returns false (item vanishes).
    - Check order of removeItem, canAddItem and addItem.

  - If toPosition points to a Container (e.g. we should add the item to the inner container),
    and the inner container moves (changes containerSlot) when the item is removed, then it won't
    be added to the inner container.
    - Move "check if toPosition is inner container" to GameEngine.
      We need that functionality for inventory too, but _not_ for World!
