1. Multiple players connected is buggy.
   * Logging in at the same spot as an already logged in player stands causes debug assertion in client (line 418, MapWindow)

2. Item on tile does not appear again after getting hidden if a creature walks away from the tile. Works if an item is being removed from the tile.
