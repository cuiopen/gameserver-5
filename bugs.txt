1. Multiple players connected is buggy.
   * Logging in at the same spot as an already logged in player stands causes debug assertion in client (line 418, MapWindow)
   * Having a player move away from another player and then moving back to the player causes the moving player to get stuck at the edge.
   * Random debug assertions when moving away / back to a player.
