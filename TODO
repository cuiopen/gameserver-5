* Rename GameEngine to PlayerManager (it manages player <-> world interaction)
* Add NPCManager (it manages npc <-> world interaction, spawns NPCs, adds OnThink tasks periodically?)
* Add simple NPC that responds on talk, walk around spawn point with max radius
* Implement combat
* Check and, if necessary, refactor Item, ItemData, ItemFactory:
  * Item should represent an unique item in the world. It only know its id and count.
  * ItemData has information for each item (using its id), loaded via .dat/.xml-files.
  * ItemFactory create Item objects given item id.
