General:
  * Fix TODOs in the code

ContainerManager:
  * Add support for moving container items (might need to update rootItemPosition and parentContainerId)
  * Add support for weight calculation

Item:
  * Refactor ItemId into ItemDataId
  * Make ItemId be unique per actual item -> Item objects needs to be handled by a single instance (GameEngine?)

                                             Moved in World/Equipment/Container by moving a pointer
                                             Only certain things can create an Item: monster loot or NPCs (via selling or giving)
                                             Can only be destroyed if thrown in water or dustbin, or if inside a corpse that vanishes
