* Add simple NPC that responds on talk, walk around spawn point with max radius

* Implement combat

* TODO in world.h

* Figure out exactly, and document in README.md, what each module should and should not do.
  Especially World and Worldserver. How much logic and knowledge should World have?

* Check/fix/sort/remove #includes and include guard names

* Fix moving creatures (PlayerManager::moveItemFromPosToPos)

* Use CMake to run tests instead of tools/test.sh
